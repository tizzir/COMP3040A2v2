## Instructions

### Acquiring the template

In this guide we're going to start by using an existing template. This template
is what provides the format and look of the resume, and we'll simply dump our
own content into it. Every template is a little different, but here we will use
[jglovier's resume template](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template). It
looks nice and clean, and setting it up requires minimal fuss.
