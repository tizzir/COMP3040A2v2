## Instructions

### Acquiring the template

In this guide we're going to start by using an existing template. This template
is what provides the format and look of the resume, and we'll simply dump our
own content into it. Every template is a little different, but here we will use
elipapa's [markdown-cv](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template) template.
It looks nice and clean, and setting it up requires minimal fuss. The following
steps guide you through template acquisition.

1. Fork the [markdown-cv repo](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv).
2. Optionally, change the name of the repo to something more specific or
   personal.
3. Clone the repo on your local machine.
4. Check out the `gh-pages` branch.  
     This branch is the one you want to be making all of your changes in. If
     you're having issues with GitHub pages displaying the latest changes
     later on, make sure the gh-pages branch has all of your latest changes,
     because it's the only branch that has any effect on deployed resume.

With these steps completed, you're ready to move onto the fun part of the
process, filling the resume with the content you want.

### Preparing your resume

Conveniently, a sample resume in the template's formatting is already provided,
so creating the resume is as easy as replacing the sample data with your own in
most cases. The steps below outline this process.

1. Open the sample resume `index.md` in the root of the repo.
2. Replace the sample contents with the contents of your own resume.  
     Note that not all markdown markers work the same way in this template as
     they do in typical markdown interepreters. Follow the markup patterns used
     in the sample template when adding your own content. The most important
     markers and their use is displayed below:
